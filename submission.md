# Paper Submission

The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing original work, written in English, not overlapping with published or simultaneously submitted work to a journal or conference with archival proceedings. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 15 pages in total excluding references.

Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be submitted electronically as PDF files via EasyChair at

For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to attend the symposium and present the work.
