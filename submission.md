# Paper Submission

The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing original work, written in English, not overlapping with published or simultaneously submitted work to a journal or conference with archival proceedings. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 15 pages in total excluding references.

Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be submitted electronically as PDF files via EasyChair at

For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to register to the symposium and present the work. 

Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained at

## Covid

TABLEAUX 2021 and FroCoS 2021 are intended to be hybrid conferences welcoming both physical and virtual participation. The organisers are closely monitoring the pandemic situation and may choose to make the conference virtual-only if it seems unreasonable to host any sort of physical event. A final decision will be taken before 14 June (12 weeks before the conference) to leave ample time for potential travel plans to be made.
