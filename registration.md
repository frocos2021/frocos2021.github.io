## Registration
TABLEAUX and FroCoS will be entirely free-of-charge to attend, but registration is mandatory to fully engage with the scientific program. We may choose to also stream talks publicly (with no need for registration), but this will be confirmed at a later date.

The registration form is [here](https://forms.gle/DRNBgeRKA4Qbcsws7).

If you wish to attend physically, you should indicate it and submit your registration form by **13 August** at the latest. Note that you are able to edit this response in case of change of circumstances. Depending on the level of interest, we may ask for more information or confirmation of physical attendance at a later point. More information about the conference format will be updated on this page.
