The 13th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems will take place in online. It will be hosted by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, on 8-10 September 2021.

FroCoS is the main international event for research on the development of techniques and methods for the combination and integration of formal systems, their modularization and analysis. The first FroCoS symposium was held in Munich, Germany, in 1996. Initially held every two years, since 2004 it has been organized annually with alternate years forming part of IJCAR.

FroCoS 2021 will be co-located with the 29th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2021).

The FroCoS 2021 conference proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS).

Scope
In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation, program development and verification, artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general purpose systems. This has led to the development of techniques and methods for the combination and integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their modularization and analysis.

The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS) traditionally focuses on these types of research questions and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2021 seeks to offer a common forum for research in the general area of combination, modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on logic-based methods and their practical use.

List of topics
Topics of interest for FroCoS 2021 include (but are not restricted to):

combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order, temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics)
combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving
combination of decision procedures, satisfiability procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical frameworks
combination of logics with probability and/or fuzzy measures
combinations and modularity in ontologies
integration of equational and other theories into deductive systems
hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint propagation
hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural language semantics
combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems
logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and specifications
integration of data structures into constraint logic programming and deduction
combinations and modularity in term rewriting
methods and techniques for the verification and analysis of information systems
methods and techniques for combining logical reasoning with machine learning
