# Best Paper Awards

The program committee will select the FroCoS 2021 Best Paper, which will be awarded 500 Euros. In addition to that, the committee will select the FroCoS 2021 Best Paper by a Junior Researcher, which will be awarded 250 Euros.

Researchers will be considered junior if either they are students or their PhD award date is less than two years from the first day of the meeting, 8 September 2021. "Paper by a Junior Researcher" means that the paper's main author is junior, or the paper's main authors are all junior. For a paper to qualify, this information must be indicated in the pdf submission by adding an asterisk (*) at both the title and the main-author name(s). This information (main authorship by junior researcher(s)) is only for the reviewers, and should be removed from the camera-ready version in case of acceptance.
